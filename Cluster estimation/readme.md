<p><b>To identify the optimal number of clusters there are different methods, I used the following two methods</b></p>
  <h2> Elbow Method </h2>
  <p> The elbow method is a heuristic method of interpretation and validation of consistency within cluster analysis designed to help find the appropriate number of clusters in a dataset</p>
  <h2> Silhouette Method</h2>
  <p> Silhouette analysis can be used to study the separation distance between the resulting clusters. The silhouette plot displays a measure of how close each point in one cluster is to points in the neighboring clusters and thus provides a way to assess parameters like number of clusters visually.</p>
