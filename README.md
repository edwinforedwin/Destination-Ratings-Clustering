Data Mining Assignment

<p>Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups.</p>
<p>There are so many clustering approaches and algorithms are now available. I used the following algorithms in this Assignment</p>
<ol>
  <li> K Means Clustering </li>
  <li> Affinity Propagation </li>
  <li> Aglomerative Clustering </li>
</ol>
